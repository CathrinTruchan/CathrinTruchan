# Hi I'm Cathrin 

After over 8 years in Marketing in the IT industry I decided to take up the challenge and learn how to code. I have always been very curious about how to develop web applications. Currently I'm a **Web Development Student** at **Neue Fische**. I'm 36 years old and live in Berlin.

## What I am currently learning:
