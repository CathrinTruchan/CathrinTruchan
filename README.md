# Hi I'm Cathrin 

After over 8 years in Marketing in the IT industry I decided to take up the challenge and learn how to code. I have always been very curious about how to develop web applications. Currently I'm a **Web Development Student** at **Neue Fische**.

## About me
In my free time I love to be active and outdoors. 
Some of my **favorite activities** are: 
- hiking 
- climbing and
- cycling 

### That's me:
